### Problem:
How to execute a Smart-Contract in Java

#### Hypothesis:
1. *TBD*

##### Findings
How to Execute Solidity Smart-Contracts with RemixIDE via [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/steps-to-execute-solidity-smart-contract-using-remix-ide/):

- Step 1: Open Remix IDE on any of your browsers, select on the New File and click on Solidity to choose the environment. 

[Remix IDE Startup Window]

- Step 2: Write the Smart contract in the code section, and click the Compile button under the Compiler window to compile the contract. 

[Compile Code]

- Step 3: To execute the code, click on the Deploy button under Deploy and Run Transactions window. 

[Deploy Code]

- Step 4: After deploying the code click on the method calls under the drop-down of deployed contracts to run the program, and for output, check to click on the drop-down on the console.
