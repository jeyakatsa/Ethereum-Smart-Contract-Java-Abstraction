# Java Smart Contract Abstraction Research & Development

### To allow the building of smart contracts in Java on Ethereum (with Rust, Python, and Go as the next focus).

#### Note: *This project started as a focused version of the [New ERC Token](https://github.com/jeyakatsa/New-ERC-Token) with an overall goal of bringing more developers into the Ethereum ecosystem.*

## Estimated Roadmap:

### Month-By-Month *(2022)*
January:
- Begin building Java Abstraction. *[Status: [In-Development](https://github.com/jeyakatsa/Ethereum-Smart-Contract-Java-Abstraction)]*
- Research & Develop Solidity-Keywords to Java-Dependency conversions *[Status: In-Development]*

February - December:
- ***Java*** Smart Contract Abstraction Build. *[Status: [In-Development](https://github.com/jeyakatsa/Ethereum-Smart-Contract-Java-Abstraction)]*
- ***Rust*** Smart Contract Abstraction Build. *[Status: Announced]*
- ***Python*** Smart Contract Abstraction Build. *[Status: Announced]*
